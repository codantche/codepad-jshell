\begin{abstract}
Learning introductory programming remains a challenge, particularly when students are required to use professional tools. BlueJ, designed under the objects-first approach, provides a simplified environment and an interactive feature known as the Code Pad, which supports exploratory learning. Since the introduction of JShell in JDK 9, Java developers have gained a professional read–eval–print–loop (REPL) tool that overlaps with some of BlueJ’s interactive capabilities. This paper investigates whether JShell can offer a learning experience comparable to BlueJ’s Code Pad in the context of introductory computer science education. Through feature-oriented modeling, benchmark examples, and a review of related literature, we identify key similarities and differences between the two tools. The results suggest that while JShell enables more powerful and flexible interactions, BlueJ retains pedagogical advantages due to its visual modeling support and simplified interface. The study contributes to understanding how professional and educational environments can converge to support diverse student needs in programming education.

\section{Introduction}

This work presents a pragmatic, pedagogical comparison between BlueJ’s Code Pad and Java’s JShell. Rather than focusing on instructional theory, the study examines how students engage with the features that are effectively available in each environment while performing introductory programming tasks.

Learning to program computers is hard. By the late 1990s, the growing need to teach object-oriented programming sparked a broad discussion on instructional approaches. Historically, programmers developed their skills by progressing from computer architecture to assembly and then to early programming languages. Within this evolution, the understanding of objects typically came later.

With the growing prevalence of object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java, an objects-first approach to teaching programming was advocated at that time. Before this shift, languages like BASIC, Smalltalk, and LISP were often learned directly—without prior exposure to other languages or to hardware concepts. Programming in these contexts occurred at a higher level of abstraction, and the objects-first approach emerged as a natural extension of this perspective.

BlueJ is a programming environment based on the objects-first learning approach, first released in 1999 \cite{barnes2008objects}\cite{bluej_paper}. Among its many features, the Code Pad was an innovation that allowed Java programmers to experiment with and explore commands without the need to write a complete application.

JShell is a read–eval–print loop (REPL) introduced in JDK 9, around 2017 \cite{jshell_docs}. Some of its features are clearly similar to those found in BlueJ’s Code Pad module and in earlier educational programming environments.

This raises the question of whether the interactive features once unique to BlueJ’s Code Pad are still necessary in introductory programming, now that JShell provides similar capabilities within the standard JDK.

%Could JShell be a replacement for Code Pad? What are the differences between educational and professional programming languages?

Using JShell may be a matter of personal preference, but to answer this question objectively we need to compare the features of Code Pad and JShell.

This study adopts a pragmatic pedagogical perspective to identify and analyze the interactive features available in both environments. 

This paper aims to analyze and compare the interactive features of BlueJ’s Code Pad and JShell from a pragmatic pedagogical perspective. The study draws on feature-oriented modeling, benchmark examples, and literature review to identify their similarities and differences.

The results are intended to inform educators and tool designers about how professional and educational environments can converge to better support introductory programming.

Ultimately, we need to better define what “education” means in programming, as professional developers never cease to learn.

\section{Motivation}

Regardless of pedagogical foundations or teaching philosophy, students respond to the tools actually at hand.
Their exploratory behavior is therefore shaped more by environmental affordances—what the interface allows them to do—than by abstract learning principles

This study is motivated by observations on the classroom of a undergraduate Computer Science course since the adoption of Java, BlueJ, and the Objects First approach.

Since the adoption of that approach, more than two decades have passed. The main factors observed on this period include: (a) an increase in computer literacy, (b) access to new devices and computer programs, and (c) the change of reference of what a computer program is.

BlueJ is a desktop application, with a look and feel that is contrasting with current applications. In particular, the multiple document interface causes the most distracting factor during classes.

Students usually prefer other programming environments, usually, Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Sometimes there is a pressure of senior students to move directly to a more professional editor. 

%Other editors include simple text editors, like Geany. No matter the editor, we can be sure that the Java Development Kit, that includes the Java Sheel, is available.

VS Code can be run locally or even on the cloud, through a web browser. This allows the students to use tablet devices and also offer a more familiar and professional looking user interface. Some students bring their own notebook or tablet devices, but most have access to more than one computer. The cloud-based VS Code will not need a separate Java and BlueJ installation and will keep all projects on the same cloud-based folder.

In this way, there is a need to offer a BlueJ-like experience for students that opt out of the BlueJ program. 

\section{Research Question}

The overall research question is broad: Could we have a BlueJ-like learning experience using professional tools?

BlueJ has many pedagogically founded features. Therefore we must compare the experience on each feature. This study focus on the interactive and exploratory learning experience offered by BlueJ Code Pad.

Therefore, the main question of this study is:
Could the use of the Java Shell provide students with a learning experience comparable to the one provided by the BlueJ Code Pad?

Even with this focus, we need to use sub-features to allow a direct comparison. By doing so, we provide a feature model that would help to understand the learning experience offered by both programs.

\section{Usage Scenarios}

Exercises from Barnes and Kolling

\subsection{Evaluate expressions}

Following the examples of the BlueJ book, the first example includes the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and a method call.

BlueJ return value and type of each expression. 
The internal structure of the objects can be visually inspected in BlueJ. 

JShell returns only the value. Data types can be consulted using the command /vars.
JShell users must recur to introspection commands, which would be out of the scope of a first programming course. 
The CLI of Java Shell at least allow the use of ids to refer to expression values,  objects  and basic types.

\begin{lstlisting}
jshell> 4 + 5
$1 ==> 9
\end{lstlisting}

Method call
\begin{lstlisting}
jshell> "Wombat".substring(3, 5)
$2 ==> "ba"
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Pragmatic Feature Comparison}
Commonality and variability are

The comparison presented here focuses on what learners can directly experience in practice, rather than on the theoretical intent of each design.

\section{Related Work}

At least on study points out the inadequacy of the Java Shell in the classroom
\cite{politz_minnes2018jshell}.

\section{Discussion}

JShell is a professional tool

BlueJ integration of many features.

BlueJ features not provided by Java Shell include class and object visual models and their integration with Code Pad.

In order to compare the potential experience, we compare features of the applications.

The need for a in-classroom is reduced, because the feature model provides a objective reference point. Variation of performance among students is a complex task, because of confounding factors as motivation, previous experience, and problem solving skills.

O termo feature é utilizado em diferentes tradições da Engenharia de Software. No contexto deste artigo, ele designa um recurso funcional das ferramentas Code Pad e JShell, em sentido semelhante ao uso em documentação técnica e em Sommerville (2015).
Reconhece-se, contudo, que o termo também possui acepções formais em Feature-Oriented Software Development (Kang et al., 1990; Batory et al., 2004) e em Behavior-Driven Development (North, 2006), onde descreve unidades de comportamento observável (feature files).

\section{Conclusion}

The Java Shell provides interactive and exploratory features that can improve the experience to programmers on all levels of maturity.

The use of professional tools on the classroom is a reality that calls for a more diverse set of tools, to accomodate a more diverse set of students.

All/many/some example of the benchmark can be reproduced using the Java Shell.

Code Pad has unique features, as the integration with visual models, and a simplified set of messages. 


Balance the power of the Java Shell with the easier adoption of BlueJ.

The pragmatic pedagogical lens adopted here emphasizes observable use: students explore, test, and learn through the specific feedback and interaction patterns that Code Pad or JShell provide.

Future work will formalize this comparison through feature modeling, allowing these pragmatic observations to be represented systematically

As a next step, we plan to formalize the comparative model using tools such as FeatureIDE, and to investigate other BlueJ features—especially visual modeling and object inspection—as subjects for future papers.
