# Codepad vs JShell

This repository is part of the **Codantchê** organization, which gathers prototypes and early-stage studies on programming education.

## Goal

To compare the functionalities of the **BlueJ Codepad** and the **JDK JShell**, focusing on:

- Available features in each interactive environment  
- Practical examples (based on the BlueJ book and JShell tutorials)  
- Possible didactic applications in introductory programming courses

### Roadmap

- **v0.1**: Literature survey + first replicated example

  
> **Codantchê**: whoever is coding, tchê!
