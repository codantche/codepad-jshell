\begin{abstract}
Learning introductory programming remains a challenge, especially when students are required to use professional tools. 
BlueJ, designed under the \textit{objects-first} approach, provides a simplified environment and an interactive feature known as the Code Pad, which enables exploratory learning. 
Since the introduction of JShell in JDK~9, Java developers have gained a professional read--eval--print--loop (REPL) tool that overlaps with some of BlueJ's interactive capabilities. 
This paper investigates whether JShell can offer a learning experience comparable to the BlueJ Code Pad in the context of introductory computer science education. 
Through feature-oriented modeling, benchmarking examples, and literature review, we identify similarities and differences between both tools. 
Results suggest that while JShell provides more powerful and flexible interactions, BlueJ retains pedagogical advantages due to its visual modeling and simplified interface. 
The study contributes to understanding how professional and educational tools can converge to support diverse student needs in programming education.

\section{Introduction}

This work presents a pragmatic pedagogical comparison between BlueJ’s Code Pad and Java’s JShell.
Rather than focusing on instructional theory, the study examines how students act upon the features effectively available in each environment during introductory programming tasks.

Learning to program computers is hard. By the late 1990s, the need to learn object-oriented programming sparked the discussion on learning aproches. Historically, programmers evolved their skills from computer architecture, to assembly, to early programming languages. In this evolution, they have learned objects later.

With the apparent prevalence of object-oriented languages, like C++ and Java, an objects-first approach was advocated, at that time. Before that, languages like BASIC, Smalltalk, and LISP were learned without the need to learn other languages fist or learn about hardware. Programming is at a higher level, in this case, the approach is objects first.

BlueJ is a programming environment that assumes the objects first learning approach, made available in 1999 \cite{barnes2008objects}\cite{bluej_paper}. Among many features, Code Pad was an innovation that let Java programmers to try and explore commands, without the need to write a complete application.

JShell is read-eval-print-loop introduced in the JDK around 2017, with JDK 9 \cite{jshell_docs}. It is apparent that some of the JShell features are similar to those found in BlueJ Code Pad module, and earlier educational programming languages. 

This may rise the question, do we still need BlueJ Code Pad on a first programming class?

%Could JShell be a replacement for Code Pad? What are the differences between educational and professional programming languages?

Using Java Shell may be just a preference, but to answer that question with facts we need to 
compare Code Pad and JShell features

Feature Modeling is

\section{Motivation}

Regardless of pedagogical foundations or teaching philosophy, students respond to the tools actually at hand.
Their exploratory behavior is therefore shaped more by environmental affordances—what the interface allows them to do—than by abstract learning principles

This study is motivated by observations on the classroom of a undergraduate Computer Science course since the adoption of Java, BlueJ, and the Objects First approach.

Since the adoption of that approach, more than two decades have passed. The main factors observed on this period include: (a) an increase in computer literacy, (b) access to new devices and computer programs, and (c) the change of reference of what a computer program is.

BlueJ is a desktop application, with a look and feel that is contrasting with current applications. In particular, the multiple document interface causes the most distracting factor during classes.

Students usually prefer other programming environments, usually, Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Sometimes there is a pressure of senior students to move directly to a more professional editor. 

%Other editors include simple text editors, like Geany. No matter the editor, we can be sure that the Java Development Kit, that includes the Java Sheel, is available.

VS Code can be run locally or even on the cloud, through a web browser. This allows the students to use tablet devices and also offer a more familiar and professional looking user interface. Some students bring their own notebook or tablet devices, but most have access to more than one computer. The cloud-based VS Code will not need a separate Java and BlueJ installation and will keep all projects on the same cloud-based folder.

In this way, there is a need to offer a BlueJ-like experience for students that opt out of the BlueJ program. 

\section{Research Question}

The overall research question is broad: Could we have a BlueJ-like learning experience using professional tools?

BlueJ has many pedagogically founded features. Therefore we must compare the experience on each feature. This study focus on the interactive and exploratory learning experience offered by BlueJ Code Pad.

Therefore, the main question of this study is:
Could the use of the Java Shell provide students with a learning experience comparable to the one provided by the BlueJ Code Pad?

Even with this focus, we need to use sub-features to allow a direct comparison. By doing so, we provide a feature model that would help to understand the learning experience offered by both programs.

%JShell was not available at the time that the BlueJ was proposed. Read-eval-loop shells were available since the adoption of interpreted languages, including the Unix bash shell, BASIC, and popular languages like Python and ECMAScript.


\section{Methodology}

Literature review

Benchmark with examples

Feature Oriented Domain Models

Comparing both programs


Most evidences are available on the paper repository \cite{mangan2025codepadjshell}.

\section{Student Expectations}

Get a job fast

Use professional tools

Write professional programs: mobile and Web clients, Web applications, games.

\section{Usage Scenarios}

Exercises from Barnes and Kolling

\subsection{Evaluate expressions}

Following the examples of the BlueJ book, the first example includes the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and a method call.

BlueJ return value and type of each expression. 
The internal structure of the objects can be visually inspected in BlueJ. 

JShell returns only the value. Data types can be consulted using the command /vars.
JShell users must recur to introspection commands, which would be out of the scope of a first programming course. 
The CLI of Java Shell at least allow the use of ids to refer to expression values,  objects  and basic types.

\begin{lstlisting}
jshell> 4 + 5
$1 ==> 9
\end{lstlisting}

Method call
\begin{lstlisting}
jshell> "Wombat".substring(3, 5)
$2 ==> "ba"
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Pragmatic Feature Comparison}
Commonality and variability are

The comparison presented here focuses on what learners can directly experience in practice, rather than on the theoretical intent of each design.

\section{Related Work}

At least on study points out the inadequacy of the Java Shell in the classroom
\cite{politz_minnes2018jshell}.

\section{Discussion}

JShell is a professional tool

BlueJ integration of many features.

BlueJ features not provided by Java Shell include class and object visual models and their integration with Code Pad.

In order to compare the potential experience, we compare features of the applications.

The need for a in-classroom is reduced, because the feature model provides a objective reference point. Variation of performance among students is a complex task, because of confounding factors as motivation, previous experience, and problem solving skills.

\section{Conclusion}

The Java Shell provides interactive and exploratory features that can improve the experience to programmers on all levels of maturity.

The use of professional tools on the classroom is a reality that calls for a more diverse set of tools, to accomodate a more diverse set of students.

All/many/some example of the benchmark can be reproduced using the Java Shell.

Code Pad has unique features, as the integration with visual models, and a simplified set of messages. 


Balance the power of the Java Shell with the easier adoption of BlueJ.

The pragmatic pedagogical lens adopted here emphasizes observable use: students explore, test, and learn through the specific feedback and interaction patterns that Code Pad or JShell provide.

Future work will formalize this comparison through feature modeling, allowing these pragmatic observations to be represented systematically

As a next step, we plan to formalize the comparative model using tools such as FeatureIDE, and to investigate other BlueJ features—especially visual modeling and object inspection—as subjects for future papers.
